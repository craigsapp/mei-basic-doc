In MEI, notes, chords and rests are often referred to as *events*.
These events are the most basic and important part of MEI.

## Notes

This is how you encode a single note in MEI:


{% include verovio-example.html
	example="basic_note.mei"
	xpath="//mei:note"
	scale="70"
	minSvgHeight="182px"
	excerptHeight="55px"
	fullEncodingHeight="500px"
	id="note_event"
%}


As you can see, the most relevant information is split into three different
attributes for easier processing. Every note requires to have a pitch name. The
**@pname** attribute may hold the following values: *c*,
*d*, *e*, *f*, *g*, *a*,
*b*.

The second part of the information about pitch is stored in the **@oct**
attribute. Octaves are given according to the Acoustical Society of America
representation, which means the middle C on a piano will have a value of
*4*, the octave above will have a *5*, the one below a
*3* and so on.

Each note needs to have a duration being set. This is done with the **@dur**
attribute. Values are integers that match the note's duration, i.e. a quarter note
will use a value of *4*, an eigth note will use *8* and so
forth. In case of a dotted note, the *optional*
**@dots** attribute is used to indicate the number of dots.

## Chords

In MEI Basic, chords strictly share a duration, that is, all notes need to have the
same duration. Accordingly, the **@dur** (and **@dots**, if necessary)
attribute(s) are a property of the chord, but not the individual notes anymore.


{% include verovio-example.html
	example="basic_chord.mei"
	xpath="//mei:chord"
	scale="70"
	minSvgHeight="182px"
	excerptHeight="140px"
	fullEncodingHeight="500px"
	id="chord_event"
%}


MEI Basic makes no assumption on the order of child notes in a chord â€“ you can start
either from the highest or lowest pitch, or mix them as you like.

## Rests

The duration of rests is specified the same way as for notes or chords, that is,
using **@dur**, and, if necessary, **@dots**.


{% include verovio-example.html
	example="basic_rest.mei"
	xpath="//mei:rest"
	scale="70"
	minSvgHeight="182px"
	excerptHeight="75"
	fullEncodingHeight="500"
	id="rest_event"
%}

Do I need to say more?
