#
# Page ordering for website:
#
# contains a list of variables scoped to specific pages on the
# website.  The scope: path contains the path of files which will have access
# to the given varaibles.  Setting the path to "" will make the variables 
# accessible to all pages.  The variables are accessed through the variable:
#     site.data.page_sequence
# where "_data/page_sequence.yml" is the name of the file.
#
# This list is also used to create the sidebar list.  The order in the list
# is the order in the sidebar.  The pages can be grouped by topic by adding
# a "category".  The categories have to be adjacent, of course.
#
# Parameters for each page entry:
#   tag == this is the filename of the page minus ".md"
#   title == this is the title of the page which will appear at the 
#            top of the page contents if you have this line at the top of the page:
#                {% include page-title.html %}
#   category == text of the heading under which the page should be listed in
#               the submenu.
